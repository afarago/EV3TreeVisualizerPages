          <p>The official Mindstorms program offers a graphical language for creating stunning programs. In the EV3G language it is easy to drag new blocks and connect the pieces like a puzzle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection see">
          <p>In EV3TreeVis each Mindstorms block is visualized as an individual block with all its input and output attributes. Blocks follow one another based on the execution sequence.</p>

        <div class="subsection learn">
          <p>Data Wires are very effective technique for "remembering" something at a block and during execution use the same information - even at a later stage. Think of it as a very effective container that can even be a time capsule. Any output parameters can start a data wire and any input parameters can receive value from a data wire. A data wire can be connected to more than one targets.</p>
          <p>Data wires have types according to the data transported. A data wire can even remember if you stored text, number, bool(yes-or-no) or several numbers or bools inside. This is called data wire type.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection see">
          <p>Data wires between blocks are tracked and handled.<br>
            Data wire naming include data wire type: number <code>dNw</code>, bool <code>dBw</code>, string <code>dSw</code>, bool array <code>dABw</code> and number array <code>dANw</code>.</p>

          <p>In the EV3 editor data wires can pass through Loop and Tabbed Switch block boundaries. This is extremely useful for more complex programs like the one below - move forward and if red was detected move back with the same distance arriving to the starting position.</p>

        <h2>Switch Blocks</h2>
        <div class="subsection learn">
          <p>Often you would like adapt your program to your environment and execute the most appropriate action related to the environment conditions. Switch block decides what to do and will execute only one of the branches depending on the input value - either by choosing a number, color or deciding whether touch sensor was pressed or not. This is called a "Case".</p>
          <p>Black circle indicates default case - this is executed when something not specified by the cases happens.<br>
            Cases can be removed by the (x) button and can be added by the (+) button.</p>
          <p>Switches can be shown either as Flat or Tabbed view by the button on the block top left corner. For now tabbed view provides nearly* the same functionality as flat view in a more condensed format. In tabbed view data wires can pass through Switch block boundaries both as inbound or outbound data.</p>
          <p><strong>Tabbed Switch blocks</strong> can receive incoming data wires and can have outgoing data wires. This is called <strong>data tunnel</strong>. Each Case can individually connect to the data wire using a very effective programming technique.</p>

          <p>An EV3 project typically contains several small indpendent programs. Often these programs do not tie together, rather are started individually from the brick's menu. In more complex projects a better overview is preferred. The project page offered by the standard EV3 software under the wrench icon is somewhat limited.</p>

          <p>When moving variables between projects, global variables are not copied. This does not yield to any runtime errors, yet can cause problems. EV3TreeVis detects and shows this as a warning. </p>

            One key factor for success during FLL is how team can handle the time limit, constrainting the robot ability to act in a simple way. 
            When you live and move in your everyday life you also move your legs, arms and several muscles all at once.
            EV3 software can also help you do two or more things in parallel. For example you might start moving 4 motors in parallel, while waiting for a touch sensor and a color sensor.

          <p>Writing several blocks of code you would like to use frequently can be boring and also quite disappointing.</p>
          <p> When creating software developers often group these blocks together and add a label to them so that it needs to be created only once. Also when you need to change anything later on you need to change it only once. </p>
          <p> In the EV3-G we call such blocks of code grouped together <b>MyBlocks</b>. These blocks can also receive inputs of any data kind and can also return values computed or collected. Use this technique if you have created something that seems multi-purpose and you would like to use it multiple times. </p>

        <h2>Data Wire Tunnel Shortcuts a.k.a. Connectors <sup><small class="badge badge-warning">Advanced technique</small></sup> </h2>
        <div class="subsection learn">
          <p> You can adjust the data flow in your programs in several ways. For a start you will use conditional blocks with repeated statements. Later on you will store data in variables based on conditions and will connect this data to the blocks used.</p>
          <p>In cases where you would like adjust the data flow based on conditional statements. An advanced technique for avoiding unnecessary variables is using wire tunnels in switch statements without any blocks shortcutting the incoming and outgoing tunnels. With this based on a condition you can determine whichever input data tunnel is connected to whichever output data tunnel. Let's call this a <strong>Connector</strong>.</p>
          <p>Use this technique with caution for simpler code and shorter programs. Make sure you have full understanding of Data Wires and Data Wire Tunnels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection see">
          <p>Data wires are visualized and are connected withing global scope traversing through the tunnels.</p>
          <p>As depending on the conditions data wires are connected in different ways a new pseudo block is added to the visualization with "Connector" name.</p>
          <p>Example taken from <a href="http://robotsquare.com/2014/07/01/tutorial-ev3-self-balancing-robot/">GyroBoy_Balanc3r robotsquare</a> site from Laurens Valk. This example creates a MyBlock where value is limited between min and max values.</p>

          <p>Your EV3 brick can communicate with up to 4 motors and 4 sensors via its ports. Motor ports are named A-B-C-D, while sensor ports and numbered by 1-2-3-4. Most often you have decided which motor to operate for moving the robot or pushing and arm that is connected to a motor.</p>
          <p> In FLL robots I have seen as a common practice B-C big EV3 motors connected to left and right wheels, while A and D medium or big motors used for handling arms interacting with mission models. Sensor usage and numbering depends on the needs for your robot (e.g. 1-3 color sensors, 4 gyro sensor). </p>
          <p>A smart programmer might consider creating an universal MyBlock which can operate on different motors (e.g. A or D) or having line following myblock working either for color sensor connected to any arbitrary port. Besides the default 'top right' port selection on the blocks, you can select port from an input data wire and create uniform and generalized code, too. This technique is called port wiring or dynamic ports. </p>
          <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> Watch out: when using wired port input for Move Tank or Steering mode you need to select the wired port input twice. Click on the left and on the right site as well. Additionally you need to use two-digit numbers for the port numbering.</div>

        <div class="subsection see">
          <p> Port wiring is displayed the same way as data wires also using the global scope.</p>

          <p> The program and the brick that you are using for programming your robot is much more complex than the ones used in the first space satellites or rockets. </p>
          <p> Software code tend to grow more and more complex as time passes by. Though EV3 is a serious play environment, you are still developing a piece of software that will autonomously run on a machine capable of <span

              class="text-muted">nearly</span> anything. </p>
          <p> In big companies, like Google, Microsoft or Facebook professionals not only develop the code we use on a daily basis, but also make sure that the code works. I mean WORKS and if there are changes or fixes they are applied smoothly. This requires a clean and simple environment. A simple and tidy room. </p>
          <p> Defining simplicity where new code can be added, existing one can be modified safely is a tough challenge. Software developers tend to define some numbers that can calculated and tell them if a code is clean and simple enough. These numbers are often called <b>Static Code Metrics</b>.</p>
          <p><strong>Complexity is not necessarily bad.</strong> If you know what you are doing and your peers or audience can still handle the code with confidence.<br>
